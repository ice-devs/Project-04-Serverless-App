# Serverless TODO

A simple TODO application that allows authenticated users of the application to create, delete and update todo items, it also allows users to upload images for individual todo items. This application is built using;
- Serverless framework script that creates
  - AWS Cloudformation template which spins up AWS resouces such as Amazon S3 Bucket, DynamoDb table
  - AWS APIGateway service
  - AWS Lambda funtions
  - S3 bucket & IAM policies  
- React 
  -  Frontend
- Auth0
  - Authenticating users

## Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

## Prerequisites

* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS account</a>
* <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0 account</a>
* <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>
* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> version up to 12.xx 
* Serverless 
   * Create a <a href="https://dashboard.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless account</a> user
   * Install the Serverless Frameworkâ€™s CLI. Refer to the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more help.

   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   serverless --version
   ```
   * Login and configure serverless to use the AWS credentials 
   ```bash
   # Login to your dashboard from the CLI. It will ask to open your browser and finish the process.
   serverless login
   # Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials to deploy the application
   # You need to have a pair of Access key (YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_KEY) of an IAM user with Admin access permissions
   sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY --profile serverless
   ```
## Installation & Usage


- ### Authentication
  - To implement authentication in your application, you would have to create an Auth0 application and set the callbackUrl value (for instance 
http://localhost:3000/callback)
  - We recommend using asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.
  - Then you copy "domain", "client id", and "callback url" values which is used to configure the `client/src/config.ts` file in the `client` folder. 
  - Also go to the application dashboard, click on **advanced settings > Endpoints**, then copy the "JSON Web Key set" value under OAauth

Clone the git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ice-devs/Serverless_TODO.git
```

- ### Backend
Locate the `serverless.yml` file and make the following changes in the file in the `backend` folder
  > Choose a name for your serverless org, app and service

  ```yml
  org:                          # serverless org name
  app:                          # serverless app name
  service:                      # service name that would be used by cloudformation
  ```

  > Update the values of environment variables ; TODOS_TABLE, ATTACHMENT_S3_BUCKET & JWKS_URL

  > **Note:** S3 bucket name must be unique, to achieve this some numbers can be added to your assigned value, for instance "mybucket178"
  ```yml
  environment:
    TODOS_TABLE: TableName-${self:provider.stage}               # Replace "TableName" with a new value
    TODOS_CREATED_AT_INDEX: CreatedAtIndex                      # does not need to be changed
    ATTACHMENT_S3_BUCKET: BucketName-${self:provider.stage}     # Replace "BuckectName" with a new value
    SIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION: 300                                  # does not need to be changed
    JWKS_URL:                                                   # "JSON Web Key set" value that you copied from auth0
  ```

After making the above changes deploy the application by running the following commands:

> Change directory into the backend folder
```
cd backend
```
> Install dependencies and deploy
```
npm install
sls deploy --verbose
```

- ### Frontend
To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters.
```ts
const apiId = '...' // API Gateway id, this value can be seen on the terminal after deploying the backend successfully
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```
And then run the following commands:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

This frontend should work with your serverless application once it is developed, you don't need to make any changes to the code. The only file that you need to edit is the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. This file configures your client application to use the API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:
